Write a function:

def solution(S)

that, given a string S consisting of N letters, returns the distance between the two identical digrams in the string that lie furthest away from each other. If there are no two identical digram inside S, your function should return -1.

Examples:


Given S = "aakmaakmakda" your function should return 7. The furthest identical digrams are "ak"s, starting in positions 2 and 9 (enumerating from 1): "aakmaakmakda".


Given S = "aaa" your function should return 1. The furthest identical digrams are "aa"s starting at positions 1 and 2.


Given S = "solidity" your function should return -1. There are no two identical digrams in S.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions: • N is an integer within the range [2..300,000]; • string S consists only of lowercase letters (a-z).
